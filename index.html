<h1>Augustin Seminel</h1>
<p>I'm learning to code on Codeacademy! My goals include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Get familiar with web development</li>
  <li>Learn and try to see if I would like to develop as one of my jobs</li>
  <li>Learn and challenge my brain</li>
  <li>Fill-in empty time in my professional schedule</li>
</ul>
<p>This is one of my favorite <a href="https://en.augustinseminel.com" target="_blank">websites!</a></p>
